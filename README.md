# Past-Exams-cs61a
 Past exam practice for cs61a
 
 Just some past practice coding problems in midterms/finals for CS 61A at UC Berkeley.
 I have transcribed some skeleton code, but they can all be found in the PDFs anyway
 
 Use `python -m doctest -v <file_name>` to run the doctests included in the questions
